DZCP Library and Framework Overview
Description
The DZCP (DZ Arena Fixers Custom Project) is a modular and extensible library designed to manage in-game events, plugins, and configurations for game environments. Built using .NET 6.0, it provides a robust framework for handling various aspects of game development, such as event management, plugin loading, and configuration handling.

Key Features
Event Management:

Easily trigger and manage in-game events like round start, round end, server start, and server stop.

Supports custom events for specific game scenarios.

Plugin System:

Load and manage plugins dynamically.

Priority-based execution ensures plugins run in the correct order.

Configuration Handling:

Flexible configuration system to customize game settings.

Supports loading and saving configurations from/to files.

Cassie Integration:

Send custom announcements using the Cassie system.

Supports both standard and noisy announcements.

API for Extensibility:

Provides a public API for external integrations and customizations.

Framework Structure
The DZCP framework is organized into several key components:

1. Events
Entities: Contains classes for game entities like players, creatures, and roles.

Game Events: Handles game-specific events such as round start, round end, and team events.

Cassie Events: Manages announcements and custom messages using the Cassie system.

2. Loader
Plugin Management: Loads and manages plugins with priority-based execution.

PluginPriorityComparer: Ensures plugins are executed in the correct order based on their priority.

3. Config
Configuration Management: Handles game settings and configurations.

IConfig Interface: Provides a flexible way to define and manage configurations.

4. API
Public API: Allows external applications to interact with the framework.

EventManager: Centralized event handling and triggering.

5. Tests
Unit Tests: Ensures the reliability and correctness of the framework.

Integration Tests: Tests the interaction between different components.

How It Works
Event Handling:

Events like RoundStartEvent, RoundEndEvent, and CassieAnnouncementEvent are triggered using the EventManager.

Example:

csharp
Copy
var roundStartEvent = new RoundStartEvent();
EventManager.TriggerEvent(roundStartEvent);
Plugin Loading:

Plugins are loaded dynamically using the Loader.

Example:

csharp
Copy
var plugin = new MyPlugin();
Loader.LoadPlugin(plugin);
Configuration Management:

Configurations are loaded and saved using the Config system.

Example:

csharp
Copy
var config = new Config { IsEnabled = true, Debug = false };
config.Save("config.yaml");
Cassie Integration:

Announcements are sent using the CassieEvents class.

Example:

csharp
Copy
CassieEvents.OnAnnouncement("Warning: Zombies detected!");
